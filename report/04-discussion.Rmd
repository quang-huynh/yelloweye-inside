# DISCUSSION

*Final discussion may include other topics. Below is a rough start.*

## IMPLICIT VS. EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE OF LIMIT REFERENCE POINTS

* How this is compliant with the DFO precautionary framework and Bill C68
* Not just a backup solution, could be argued that this is "implicit" knowledge is a better solution then the usual "explicit" knowledge

## FORMAT OF THE ADVICE

* Suggested elements to include in a Research Document
* Suggested elements to include in a SAR
* Potential use of SRs to update advice
* Potential to assess multiple spatial regions and related species simultaneously

## REASSESSMENT FREQUENCY AND TRIGGERS

* Annual(?) updating of catch recommendation
* Less frequent revisiting of the OM and potential changes to MP/HCR
* Some suggested interval barring a trigger

* Identifying mismatches between the operating model and realized data
* Suggested that these are checked on some regular interval
* Which data are we suggesting to check

## INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

* Tie into bill C68 and ecosystem approach to fisheries management working group
* Perhaps one of the most feasible ways to include environmental effects is via operating models

## ASSESSING THE VALUE OF INFORMATION

* Possibly draw on the value of aging data for English sole from a case study as an example
* Can also suggest other possible uses, e.g., changes to survey coverage

## REBUILDING PLANS

* Brief overview
* Note the upcoming yelloweye inside application
