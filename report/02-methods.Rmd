# METHODS

*TODO: Edit all of this text. Placeholder for now. RF can do this*

We follow the methods recommended in the Management Procedure Framework for Groundfish in British Columbia [@anderson2020]. The framework follows six best practice steps described below. For more details on the best practice steps see @anderson2020.

@punt2016 reviewed best practices for MSE and identified five key steps in the process (Steps 2--6 below). In large part, the DLMtool software has been designed to allow practitioners to follow these steps [Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart); @carruthers2018]. We also identify a critical first step (Step 1 below): defining the decision context [@gregory2012 and Cox and Benson (unpublished)].

*TODO: Mention this is done in a simulation framework. Very briefly introduce dlmtool and msetool here*

## BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE APPROACH 

### STEP 1: DEFINE THE DECISION CONTEXT {#sec:approach1}

The decision to be made is which MP to use to determine catch limits for the period until the next available catch advice. The time-frame for making the decision should be stated in the request for science advice.

The boundaries on the project ...

The final decision on which MP to use to determine catch limits should be made based on a consensus by the Regional Peer Review (RPR) committee, after review of the scientific content of the advice (including the structure and content of the OMs), and consideration of the relative performance of the MPs with respect to meeting stated objectives and trade-offs among performance metrics. 

### STEP 2: SELECTION OF OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE METRICS  {#sec:approach2}

Here we describe a set of provisional objectives and associated performance metrics. In real applications of the framework, objectives should be refined on a stock-by-stock basis, with advice from Fisheries Management, First Nations, commercial and recreational fishing representatives, NGOs and other affected parties. Other objectives could be added (e.g., cultural objectives), decided on a stock-by-stock basis.

Key provisional conservation objectives are guided by the PA Framework [@dfo2006; @dfo2009] and rebuilding plan guidance [**REF**], elements of which are incorporated into the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* (see Section \@ref(motivation)). Additional objectives related to fisheries yield and variability in annual fisheries yield are based on precedents in other DFO Pacific Region analyses [e.g., @cox2008a; @forrest2018; @cox2019].

We propose the following provisional tactical conservation and fisheries objectives:

*TODO: LIST THE REBUILDING PLAN OBJECTIVES. How have these changed compared to the original objectives and why?*

*TODO: Also list COSEWIC objectives*


* Length of projection period for the simulations, 
* Consideration of other processes (e.g., the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, COSEWIC) may require a specific projection period based on metrics such as generation time.

We propose the following performance metrics, where MSY refers to maximum sustainable yield, *B*~MSY~ refers to equilibrium spawning biomass at MSY, and *F*~MSY~ refers to the fishing mortality that produces MSY over the long term:

*TODO: List the performance metrics*


### STEP 3: SELECTION OF UNCERTAINTIES/SPECIFICATION OF OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3}

DLMtool OMs are organized into four main components representing a real fished system:

1. population dynamics of the fish stock (e.g., growth, recruitment, mortality);
2. fishery dynamics (e.g., selectivity, spatial targeting);
3. observation processes (e.g., bias and precision in survey indices); and
4. management implementation (e.g., percentage overages of catch limits).

Parameters under the four components are entered into "slots" [terminology referring to a feature of the S4 object-oriented system in R; @r2019] and in Appendix B of @carruthers2018.

DLMtool allows the incorporation of uncertainty in most OM parameters through optional specification of a distribution, typically a uniform distribution between two bounds. See Appendix B of @carruthers2018 for a full list of parameters for which a distribution can be specified. However, to isolate the effects of specific sources of uncertainty on performance of MPs, we recommend development of alternative OMs that change the value (or distribution) of one parameter or data source of interest.

We recommend developing more than one OM, dividing OMs into a reference set of core OMs representing the most important plausible model uncertainties, and a robustness set for testing sensitivity to a broader range of structural uncertainties [@rademeyer2007].

*Identify key uncertainties to include in OMs in the reference and robustness sets*

We note that DLMtool OMs includes a very large number of parameters that can vary through time, or which can be set to be deliberately biased. To simplify the operating model and focus on what are likely the most important axes of uncertainty, we suggest fixing most parameters to be time-invariant and unbiased (see @anderson2020, their Appendix \@ref(app:default-slots)). 

Best practice recommends calibrating OMs with observed data so they can reproduce historical observations (e.g., indices of abundance, age-composition data). 

*TODO: shorten this and make specific to Inside YE*
DLMtool's companion software package, MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019], includes an extremely efficient implementation of a stock reduction analysis (SRA) [@kimura1982; @walters2006], which is effectively a catch-at-age model that estimates the combinations of historical fishing mortality and recruitment that would be consistent with the observed data. The SRA implementation in MSEtool can be conditioned on catch or effort time series. For most applications for BC groundfish stocks, we suggest conditioning on catch, as historical trajectories of catch tend to be more reliable than time series of effort, especially given uncertainties in how to best represent and interpret effort in multispecies fisheries. An advantage of using MSEtool's SRA for calibrating OMs is it allows fitting to multiple indices of abundance, and can accommodate multiple fishing fleets if needed.

The SRA model is used to condition the following OM parameters:

* unfished recruitment
* depletion
* relative fishing effort
* annual recruitment deviations
* selectivity parameters (if age or length composition data are included as inputs to the SRA)

*TODO. Decide if we will have our own SRA appendix or refer to MP Framework*

Further details on the SRA OM-calibration model are available in Appendix \@ref(app:sra).

### STEP 4: IDENTIFICATION OF CANDIDATE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES  {#sec:approach4}

@anderson2020 screened all MPs available in DLMtool as of November 2019 along with recent MPs used in BC groundfish reports to consider their appropriateness for the framework.
This represents a fairly comprehensive set of data-limited MPs available in the primary literature or agency reports to date.

We describe candidate MPs for consideration for Inside YE in detail in Appendix \@ref(app:MPs).

DLMtool includes MPs that make different types of management recommendations.
These recommendations include adjustments to total allowable catch (TAC), effort, or spatial allocation of catch or effort.
For Inside YE, we focus on MPs that make TAC recommendations because the stock is managed by quotas.

We focus on two main types of MPs: data-based and model-based MPs.

All MPs included in this framework are fully described in Appendix \@ref(app:MPs).

#### Data-based MPs

*TODO. List the MPs we are using and refer to the appendix*

#### Model-based MPs

*TODO. List the MPs we are using and refer to the appendix*

#### Reference MPs

In addition to the candidate MPs, it is important to include reference MPs. Provisionally, we suggest the following reference MPs:

* No fishing
* Fishing at F/F~MSY~
* Fishing at 0.75 F/F~MSY~
* Maintaining the current TAC

The purpose of reference MPs is not to explore viable management strategies but to bound the range of expected or possible performance and contextualize whether differences between performance statistics among MPs are meaningful [@punt2016]. For example, the "no fishing" reference MPs provides information on maximum possible stock levels and the maximum possible rate of rebuilding under a rebuilding scenario. The "fishing at 0.75 F/F~MSY~" MP illustrates performance under an omniscient manager with perfect information. The MP that maintains the current TAC is included not because we think it is necessarily a good management strategy but illustrates what is likely the default had the framework not been implemented and illustrates the long-term performance expectations given current exploitation levels.


### STEP 5: SIMULATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES  {#sec:approach5}

Once the objectives, performance metrics, calibrated OMs and MPs are fully specified, a closed-loop simulation framework (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart)) can be applied to test relative performance of the MPs with respect to meeting the stated objectives.

We recommend beginning with a satisficing step, where trial simulations are run to screen out MPs that do not meet a basic set of performance criteria [@miller2010].
For example, in our illustrative Rex Sole case study (Appendix \@ref(app:mse-rex)), we screened out MPs that did not achieve a long-term 90% probability of keeping the stock above the LRP (LT P40 $\geq$ 0.9) and a short-term 75% probability of yield above 50% MSY (STY $\geq$ 0.75).
This resulted in **XX** final MPs, plus the four reference MPs.

DLMtool is designed to follow standard MSE operating procedure (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart)), where the OM is used to simulate the various data streams required by the MP at each time step, then the biomass is projected forward under the prescribed MP at each subsequent time step until the projection period is complete.
Performance is then evaluated through calculation of performance statistics in the OM.
DLMtool makes use of the C++ programming language and parallel processing, making the simulations computationally efficient [@carruthers2018].

For each OM-MP combination, multiple replicate projections are run to account for observation and process errors in the data streams.
This is achieved by adding stochastic noise to the data (e.g, indices of abundance) before passing them to the MP. Coefficients of variation in the data should be consistent with those in historical observations [@rademeyer2007]. Typically, at least 100 replicate simulations are run for each OM/MP combination.
We suggest selecting sufficient replicates so that the rank order of MPs across the performance metrics remains consistent regardless of additional iterations [@carruthers_user_2019].
